A mock IR simulation was performed for an H2O system using the xtb calculator. The simulation identified three distinct vibrational frequencies at 271.0 cm⁻¹, 2161.9 cm⁻¹, and 2865.8 cm⁻¹. It is important to note that this was a demonstration run, and as indicated, calculators like xtb may not inherently provide physically accurate IR intensities due to the lack of explicit dipole moment derivatives, focusing primarily on vibrational frequencies.
